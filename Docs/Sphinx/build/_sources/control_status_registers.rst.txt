Control Status Registers 
======================== 

RV32-Apogeo doesn't implement all CSRs proposed by RISC-V specifications, only essentials ones are actually keeped to reduce area ovehead. Specification says that there are bit fields with certains properties. 

Some bit fields specify a precise behaviour for a subset of the possible bit combinations:

* **WLRL** (Write Legal Read Legal): **No illegal instruction exceptions are raised** in case of an illegal bit combination write, in this case the write doesn't change the CSR state and the lastest legal value will be read.
* **WARL** (Write Any Read Legal): Any combination of bit write will always be legal.

Some CSRs can only be readed (**RO**, read only) or can be freely accessed (**RW**, read / write).

All CSRs have a privilege mode associated. RV32-Apogeo implements 3 different modes:

* **M**: Machine mode
* **U**: User mode

A CSR with *X* mode can only be accessed by an instruction in *Y* mode that have the same or higher privilege level.

Machine Mode CSRs
-----------------

.. note:: The bits that are present in the official RISC-V specifications but not present in the table will return a 0 if read.


ISA CSR
~~~~~~~

Machine ISA (**misa**) CSR contains informations about the implemented CPU ISA. Extensions implemented can be read through this register. Another use is to disable M and F extensions, by clearing the corresponding bit into the *Extensions* bit field.

     - 0x141126


ID CSRs
~~~~~~~

CSRs like **mvendorid**, **marchid**, **mimpid** and **mhartid** privide a simple mechanism to identify the CPU core. They are all *read-only* registers and will return a 0 except for *marchid* CSR. A read to that will return the value: **0x41504F47** (APOG in ASCII). 

.. note:: It's possible do shut off multiplier, divisor and bit manipulation unit by clearing the M and B bit of **marchid** CSR. Every M / B instruction will then result in an exception.

Status CSR
~~~~~~~~~~

The machine status register: **mstatus**, keeps track of and controls the hartâ€™s current operating state.

     - 0
   * - [3]
     - MIE 
     - RW 
     - Global interrupt enable
     - 1

.. note:: On reset, MPP bit is set to 1, which means that after the execution of `MRET` instruction, the core won't switch to *user mode*. If the programmer wants to do that, he needs to write 0 to MPP and then execute `MRET`


Trap-Vector CSR 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **mtvec** register hold the base address of the memory location that will be loaded into the PC. RISC-V supports 2 different modes of interrupt handling:

* Direct: PC will be loaded directly with the BASE address
* Vectored: When an *interrupt* occours the PC is loaded with BASE + (4 * CAUSE_VECTOR). The vector is received from the external interrupting device or from an external interrupt controller. In case of a syncronous exception (*trap*), the processor behave as the mode is *direct*.

Interrupt Status CSRs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **mip** and **mie** registers control the machine interrupt. The **mip** register keeps track of *pending interrupts* while through **mie** register single interrupts can be disabled. On an interrupt cause 'i' correspond the bit 'i' in MIP and MIE set.

An interrupt will be taken if:
* Current privilege mode is M and mstatus.MIE is set, or the current privilege mode is less privileged than M-mode.
* Bit 'i' is set in both MIE and MIP.

The **mip** register has the following field implemented:

.. list-table:: MIP CSR
   :widths: 10 15 15 45 15
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Bits
     - Name

     - Default Value
   * - [11]
     - MEIP
     - RO 
     - External interrupt pending
     - 0
   * - [7]
     - MTIP 
     - RO 
     - Timer interrupt pending
     - 0


The **mie** register has the following field implemented:

.. list-table:: MIE CSR
   :widths: 10 15 15 45 15
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Bits
     - Name
     - Access Mode

     - Default Value
   * - [11]

     - RO 
     - External interrupt enable
     - 0
   * - [7]
     - MTIP 
     - RO 
     - Timer interrupt enable
     - 0


**MEIE** and **MEIP** bits refers to external interrupts handled by the interrupt controller. Apogeo has 1 single general interrupt pin which is managed by the interrupt controller based on priority levels. **MTIE** and **MTIP** bits refers to the external memory mapped CSR (timer). The **time** CSR interrupt has priority over the external one.

.. note:: The pending bits are *read only* and can only be cleared by performing special operation. To clear the timer interrupt pending bit for example, it's necessary to manually change the *timer compare register* or change the *timer value*. For the external interrupt, the hardware will take care of it by running an acknowledge cycle to announce the interrupt controller that the core is going to service the request.


Exception Program Counter CSR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an exception is taken into M-mode, the PC of the interrupting instruction is saved into **mepc** register, later is restored to continue executing the program.


Exception Cause CSR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To identify the exception cause **mcause** register save useful info.

Hardware Performance Monitor CSRs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Those are 64 bits registers (divided in two registers of 32 bits) that increment themselves as an event occour. The **mcycle** CSR simply increment every clock cycle, **minstret** CSR increment itself when an instruction is retired from the *reorder buffer*. 

RV32-Apogeo implements other 4 general purpouse counters: **mhpmcounter3** -> **mhpmcounter6**.
The increment-enable event can be selected through the **mhpmevent3** -> **mhpmevent6**. 

The events available are:

* Machine cycle
* Data store executed
* Data load executed
* Interrupt taken
* Exception taken
* Branch mispredicted
* Branch encountered

The codes of the events goes from 1 (machine cycle) to 7 (branch encountered).


Counter-Enable CSR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reads in U-mode to those CSRs are permitted only if the corresponding bit in **mcounteren** CSR is asserted (bit set to 1). If the bit is cleared and U-mode code tries to read the associated CSR, an *illegal instruction exception is raised*. The **time** CSR can always be always accessed by lower level privilege.

Scratch Register
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **mscratch** register is used to store temporary information by M-mode code, typically, it is used to hold a pointer to a machine-mode hart-local context space and swapped with a user register upon entry to an M-mode trap handler.


Time Register
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **time** register is a simple 64 bits counter. The peculiarity of this CSR is that it's *memory mapped*, this means that the CSR will be accesses only through load and store instructions instead of special CSR instructions. The register can be accessed by both U-mode and M-mode code.

It has two 64 bits register, which translate in four 32 bits registers. The **time** register itself hold the current value of the CSR, the **timecmp** register holds the value that will trigger an interrupt once the counter reach that.

The base address of the register can be configured, the default value is the first address of the IO space.


.. list-table:: MCOUNTERINHIBIT CSR
   :widths: 25 15 15 40 15
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Address 
     - Name
     - Access Mode
     - Description
     - Default Value
   * - BASE + 0
     - time
     - RW
     - Lower 32 bits of the *time* CSR
     - 0
   * - BASE + 1
     - timeh
     - RW
     - Higher 32 bits of the *time* CSR
     - 0
   * - BASE + 2
     - timecmp
     - RW
     - Lower 32 bits of the *timecmp* CSR
     - 0
   * - BASE + 3
     - timecmph
     - RW
     - Higher 32 bits of the *timecmp* CSR
     - 0

The software should always write first to the lower 32 bits of any register and then proceed to the higher 32 bits to prevent any bug.


User Mode CSRs
--------------

The user mode CSRs are mostly **shadows of the M-mode CSRs**, that means a read of a particular CSR, will target a machine mode CSR. The **M-mode performance counters** are all accessable by U-level code *only if the relative bit of mcounteren CSR is asserted*. 

There are some registers that can be accessed freely by U-level code without checking the *mcounteren* CSR. We have already talked about the **time** and **timecmp** in the previous paragraph.
