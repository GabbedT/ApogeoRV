# CONTRIBUTING

Any kind of help is highly appreciated, your feedback, suggestions, and contributions play a crucial role in the project development! If you have any questions, bug reports, ideas, or any other kind of feedback, please do not hesitate to open a new issue or start a discussion.

## Contributing Process

Follow the steps below if you wish to make code modifications or enhancements to this project:

1. Begin by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Once you've forked the repository, clone your fork locally.
2. Instead of working directly on the main branch, create a separate branch for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.
4. Implement your feature or fix and commit the changes. Remember to write clear commit messages: `git commit -m "Describe your change here" -s`. The -s flag is for signing off your commits, indicating you agree to the terms of the project.
5. After committing your changes, push the branch to your forked repository on GitHub: `git push origin <branch_name>`
6. Go to your fork on GitHub and create a new pull request. Ensure that your feature branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from the project's main branch before submitting. Describe the changes you made, why you made them, and any other relevant details to help understand and review your contribution.

## Final Notes

* Please ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding style.
* Write unit tests, if applicable, to validate the functionality of your changes.
* Test the entire system to ensure that everything works correctly with the new features.
* Ensure that your PR includes clear documentation on any new features or changes.
* Always base your work on the most recent version of the main branch to minimize merge conflicts.
